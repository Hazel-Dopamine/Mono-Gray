						<p> Hazel Dopamine is an elegant themed cafe with hazelnuts. Our cafe serves many types of drink flavors such as coffee, tea and chocolate. Each drink has its own mix and unique taste. Apart from that, our cafe also serves desserts as a side dish while our customers are hanging out in our cafe. With that said, it is not a problem for customers to take a long time to hang out in our cafe as we also serve desserts for dessert while hanging out. Other than that, this is because the desserts and types of drinks we serve are a compatible combination and are able to give customers peace of mind.</p>
